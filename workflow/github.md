# GitHub

GitHub is used across the University and the world for version control and hosting projects.

## Training Repository

Feel free to download or clone my training repository [Fred](https://github.umn.edu/jennz/fred) to see how repositories track changes. If you look at the commits, you can see how Fred changed from a caterpillar to a giant moth that destorys towns.
